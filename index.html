            <h2>Dear Mr. Tony,</h2>
            <p>I hope this letter finds you in great health and high spirits. It has been a while since we last talked, and I wanted to take some time to check in on you. How have you been? How’s everything going on your side?</p>
            <p>Things have been moving along steadily on my end. I have been working on some exciting projects, learning new things, and staying busy with different activities. Life has its ups and downs, but I try to make the most of every moment.</p>
            <p>I was also wondering if you have had the chance to take a break and enjoy some free time. Sometimes, we get so caught up in work and responsibilities that we forget to relax and have fun. Have you done anything interesting lately? Maybe a trip, a hobby, or something new you’ve been trying?</p>
            <p>Also, if there’s anything I can do to help or if you just want to chat, don’t hesitate to let me know. I always enjoy catching up and hearing about what’s going on in your world.</p>
            <p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon! Take care and stay safe.</p>
            <p>Best regards,<br>Your Friend</p>
